Kotlin is a concise a safe language that helps to avoid lots of well know problems of software development.
Being interoperable with Java allows Kotlin to use all the experience and benefits of Java platform and ecosystem. 

In this course we will understand how to use Kotlin and it's ecosystem for **backend** development.

We will
 - give you a kickstart into the Kotlin world
 - provide relevant materials and links
 - share the practice of Kotlin usage in production

You will 
 - explore how to work with mature java frameworks and brand new Kotlin ones
 - learn how to build and ship Kotlin applications
 - create a final project in small teams

# Tech stack

- Frameworks: Spring(boot, data, mvc)
- Build: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
- Transport: Http, Websocket, mq(?)
- Storage: PostgreSQL
- Containerization: Docker
- CI/CD: Travis-Ci, codecov, codacy
- Version control: Git

# Who is this class for
This class is intended for experienced developers who has at least 1 year of Java development experience or 3+ years development in any other language.

We expect you know or able to know:
1. How to install JDK and setup IDE
1. Build tools basics (Maven / Gradle / Ant / ...)
1. OOP basics (class, interface, polymorphism)
1. What is Http and how it works
1. How git works (clone, pull, fetch, push, rebase)

We expect you to spend **10+** hours a week on coding/reading/learning.

# In this class you will not
- learn anything about Android

# Final project
Working in a small groups (2-3 devs)
We will create a multiplayer backend for a [Bomberman game](https://youtu.be/Uz-lLYh-_S4?t=4m7s).

Your project will be implemented using microservice architecture:
- 2+ microservices (metagame, matchmaking, game server, ...)
- frontend application (provided by us)
- http / websocket / mq transport

For curious there will be a possibility to create kotlin-js project for your bomberman frontend.
